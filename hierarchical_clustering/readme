Hierarchical clustering involves creating clusters that have a predetermined ordering from top to bottom. For example, all files and folders on the hard disk are organized in a hierarchy. There are two types of hierarchical clustering, Divisive and Agglomerative.
Divisive method:
    In divisive or top-down clustering method we assign all of the observations to a single cluster and then partition the cluster to two least similar clusters. Finally, we proceed recursively on each cluster until there is one cluster for each observation. There is evidence that divisive algorithms produce more accurate hierarchies than agglomerative  algorithms in some circumstances but is conceptually more complex.
Agglomerative method:
    In agglomerative or bottom-up clustering method we assign each observation to its own cluster. Then, compute the similarity (e.g., distance) between each of the clusters and join the two most similar clusters. Finally, repeat steps 2 and 3 until there is only a single cluster left.
Above example is of Agglomerative clustering method.
